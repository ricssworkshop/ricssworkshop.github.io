We encourage authors of accepted papers to participate in the **Artifact Evaluation (AE)** process. Although optional, this initiative promotes transparency and reproducibility by assessing the artifacts that support your research.

### What is Artifact Evaluation?

Artifacts refer to digital objects such as software, datasets, test suites, mechanized proofs, and other material that support the results presented in the paper. The AE process evaluates whether these artifacts:

- Support the claims made in the paper.
- Are complete and well-documented.
- Are easy to reuse for further research.

### Submission Guidelines

- **Deadline**: Approximately one month before the workshop date.
- **Process**: After paper acceptance, authors will receive instructions on how to submit their artifacts for evaluation. In general, the submission process and the evaluation criteria follow the [CCS Guidelines](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/call-for-artifacts/). 
- **Confidentiality**: The AE process is single-blind. Evaluators will know the authors’ identities, but authors will not know the evaluators’. All artifacts will be held in confidence and not publicized.

### Benefits of Participation

- **Recognition**: Successful artifacts may receive a badge indicating availability and quality, which can be displayed in the final paper.
- **Artifact Appendix**: Authors are encouraged to include an appendix describing the artifact to enhance transparency and reproducibility.

The artifact evaluation process at RICSS 2025 was inspired by [ACM CCS 2025 Call for Artifacts](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/call-for-artifacts/) in conjunction of multiple prior conferences.
