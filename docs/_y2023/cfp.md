## Call For Papers

All papers discussing ICS and its application security are solicited for submission. RICSS particularly welcomes position papers which propose provocative thoughts on how (parts of) the current ICS system could be re-envisioned for security. This includes proposals that may compromise todayâ€™s ICS reliability to improve its security tomorrow. We also welcome proposals discussing the challenges in designing, incorporating, and maintaining secure open-source ICS software.

All accepted papers and presentations will be considered for **Best Paper Award** and **Best Presentation Award**. 
  The winner and runner-up will be nominated by the program committee and the authors. Travel grants for students might be available.

**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:**
- ICS, PLC, IIoT security mechanism design
- Secure ICS software development framework designs
- ICS/SCADA security testbed designs
- Security standard designs
- Risk management in open source ICS software
- Trust architecture in the open-source process
- Performance evaluation of security methods and tools in ICS
- Vulnerability analysis and risk management framework designs
- Digital forensics framework for ICS 
- Intrusion detection and prevention solutions for ICS software
- Emerging threats to ICS

**Submission**

For its first edition, RICSS workshop accepts two types of contributions. All papers must be written in English and the paper length should range from 4 to 8 pages using the [IEEE conference proceeding template](https://eurosp2023.ieee-security.org/eurosp2023-template.zip) (excluding references and appendices). Reviewers are not required to read the appendices. Submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions are anonymous. It is the authors' responsibility to ensure that their anonymity is preserved when citing their own work.
- **Regular paper**: Traditional research papers with novel contributions, should consist of a title, abstract, and brief motivation for and description of the idea. The paper can describe an ongoing research in various stages, or a novel idea or challenge, without proof-of-concept or preliminary results. The aim is to allow the authors to refine their ideas via the feedback from the workshop audience, to stimulate more research ideas, and to encourage collaborations. Submitted paper must be 4 to 8 pages, including all figures. 

- **Presentation** of previously accepted papers: Authors of previously accepted papers (that are of interest to the workshop) can *resubmit* their papers to be able to present them in the workshop. For such contributions, there is no page limitation on the submission, and anonymization is not necessary.

Papers must be submitted at [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ricss2023) and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires.


**Publication and presentation**

Organizing committee will evaluate the submissions based on relevancy, impact, and the potential to spark discussion at the workshop. Interdisciplinary work is appreciated and encouraged. The proceedings will be published by the IEEE after the workshop and will be made available in IEEE Xplore. During submission, authors can choose to have their paper excluded from the proceedings. For each accepted paper, *one of the authors will need to present the paper in the workshop*.
