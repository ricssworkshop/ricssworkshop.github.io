<!-- The first RICSS workshop will take place in Delft, Netherlands, co-located with IEEE EuroS&P 2023.  -->

<!-- # Program -->

<!-- **Format**: 
<!-- The RICSS workshop is planned to be held **in hybrid**.  -->
<!-- The presenters will be one of the authors of accepted papers. There will also be a keynote speaker and a selection of invited speakers. -->

<!-- At least one author per accepted paper must register before <span style="color:red">**1st June, 2023**</span>. IEEE Euro S&P and co-located workshops are physical events and authors are expected to present their work in person. If you foresee any objective reasons preventing all the authors of your paper from traveling, please contact the [General Chair](mailto:eurosp2023-general-chairs@ieee-security.org). -->
