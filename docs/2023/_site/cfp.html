<p>All papers discussing ICS and its application security are solicited for submission. RICSS particularly welcomes position papers which propose provocative thoughts on how (parts of) the current ICS system could be re-envisioned for security. This includes proposals that may compromise today’s ICS reliability to improve its security tomorrow. We also welcome proposals discussing the challenges in  designing, incorporating, and maintaining secure open-source ICS software.</p>

<p><strong>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>ICS, PLC, IIoT security mechanism design</li>
  <li>Secure ICS software development framework designs</li>
  <li>ICS/SCADA security testbed designs</li>
  <li>Security standard designs</li>
  <li>Risk management in open source ICS software</li>
  <li>Trust architecture in the open-source process</li>
  <li>Performance evaluation of security methods and tools in ICS</li>
  <li>Vulnerability analysis and risk management framework designs</li>
  <li>Digital forensics framework for ICS</li>
  <li>Intrusion detection and prevention solutions for ICS software</li>
  <li>Emerging threats to ICS</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>

<p>For its first edition, RICSS workshop accepts three types of contributions. All papers must be written in English and must not exceed 10 pages (full) and 6 pages (short) using the IEEE conference proceeding template (excluding references and appendices). Reviewers are not required to read the appendices. Submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions are anonymous. It is the authors’ responsibility to ensure that their anonymity is preserved when citing their own work.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Full paper</strong>: Traditional research papers with novel contributions, must be no longer than 10 pages, including all figures.</li>
  <li><strong>Short paper</strong>: The proposal should consist of a title, abstract, and brief motivation for and description of the idea. The proposal can describe an ongoing research in various stages, or a novel idea or challenge, without proof-of-concept or preliminary results. The aim is to allow the authors to refine their ideas via the feedback from the workshop audience, to stimulate more research ideas, and to encourage collaborations. Submitted proposals must be no longer than 6 pages, including all figures.</li>
  <li><strong>Presentation</strong> of previously accepted papers: Authors of previously accepted papers (that are of interest to the workshop) can resubmit their papers to be able to present them in the workshop. For such contributions, there is no page limitation on the submission, and anonymization is not necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Publication and presentation</strong></p>

<p>Organizing committee will evaluate the submissions based on relevancy, impact, and the potential to spark discussion at the workshop. Interdisciplinary work is appreciated and encouraged. The proceedings will be published by the IEEE after the workshop and will be made available in IEEE Xplore. During submission, authors can choose to have their paper excluded from the proceedings. For each accepted paper, one of the authors will need to present the paper in the workshop.</p>
